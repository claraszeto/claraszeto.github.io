		<h1>Experience is the one thing you can't buy.</h1>
		
		<p>
		It has been proven, you CAN buy happiness. However, experience is one thing you can't buy, because you haven't gone through it, lived through it, been through it, just like you won't know what love is until you have really fallen in love.

	<br></br>

		<br>So, where do I come in?</br>

	<br></br>

		This website cannot provide you with experience, however, I can share my experiences and some rules and techniques that I've learnt the way to maybe guide you to prevent catastrophic experiences.
